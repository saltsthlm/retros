# Retrospective plans

## Retro what?

A retrospective (or retro for short) is the most important meeting for any process that aims to improve.
A retrospective is a regular meeting where we look back and learn from our progress, failure and feelings and try to come up with some small actions to improve our way of working in the future.

It's more useful to do small improvements frequently than to do big improvements seldom.
