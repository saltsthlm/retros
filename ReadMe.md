# Retrospective plans

## Retro what?

A retrospective (or retro for short) is the most important meeting for any process that aims to improve.
A retrospective is a regular meeting where we look back and learn from our progress, failure and feelings and try to come up with some small actions to improve our way of working in the future.

It's more useful to do small improvements frequently than to do big improvements seldom.

## JavaScript Full Stack Developer

These are the retrospective plans we are using during the course:

* [The awesome and deltas](AwesomeAndDeltas.md)
* [The walk & talk](WalkAndTalk.md)
* [The sailboat](Sailboat.md)
* [The lean coffee](LeanCoffee.md)
* [The proud and worried](ProudAndWorried.md)

## Other great resources for retro facilitators

Although the scripts above are awesomely fun they are limited in numbers. Here are some other resources that you might find useful:

* [The Retromat](https://retromat.org/en/) that will generate a new retrospective script every time
* [The Retrospective wiki](http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Retrospective_Plans) has another long list of retrospective plans that you can pick from
* [The hyper island toolbox](https://toolbox.hyperisland.com) has a lot of smaller exercises that can be put together to a retrospective
* [Fun Retrospectives](http://www.funretrospectives.com/) is the place to go for ... fun retrospectives. It's another list of many scripts and activities that can be in your retrospectives
* [Spotify Retro Kit](https://labs.spotify.com/2017/12/15/spotify-retro-kit/) here are a few ideas from Spotify that are well worth looking into

The book [Agile Retrospectives](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649) is a good read if you want to learn more about the underlying ideas and concepts
