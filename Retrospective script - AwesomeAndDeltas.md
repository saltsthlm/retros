# Retrospective script - Awesome & Deltas

The purpose of this, and every retrospective, is to help us to improve by coming up with a few concrete improvement actions that we can complete / test / do until the next retrospective.  Small, concrete actions are preferred before large lofty goals that we don't reach anytime soon. There will be another retrospective in a few weeks. 

This is a basic and easy to run a retrospective. All other retrospectives are variants on this theme. 

You will need a big piece of paper or a whiteboard and some post-its

The duration of this retrospective is about 45 minutes

## Review (5 min)

- Read the previous improvment actions
- Did we do them?
  - If no - why not? 
  - If yes - what happened? 
- What should we think about writing new action items?  

## Generate data

1. Get a A3-paper and table you comfortably can sit around
   1. Draw a mood diagram for the first two weeks
   2. Each of you draw their own lines while telling how you felt. For example: I was very confused the first two days, the AW cheered me up and from the second week I felt awesome. 
   3. Spend max 1 / person

## Generate insights

1. Now create a big cross on the flipside of the A3. 
   1. On the left side we will list all positive things
   2. On the left side we will list all the things that we could improve
2. Under 10 minutes silence each of you write down things that should go in each column on sticky notes
   1. Write one thing per sticky!
   2. Write legible!
   3. Post them as you have written them - anywhere on the right side will due
3. After the 10 mins is up - group the notes that belongs together
   1. You can do this silently if you want
4. Discuss based of the generated insights, and the mood diagram, come up with max 2 action items that you can and will improve until the next Friday
   1. I rather you do small thing that you complete than big things that you start. 
   2. Note down the actions and how you would know when they are completed on new stickies. 
      1. Bring them to your mob station
