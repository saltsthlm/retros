# Retrospective script - the walk & talk

The purpose of this, and every retrospective, is to help us to improve by coming up with a few concrete improvement actions that we can complete / test / do until the next retrospective.  Small, concrete actions are preferred before large lofty goals that we don't reach anytime soon. There will be another retrospective in a few weeks.

This particular retrospective is an outdoors-y exercise that is easy going and requires little preparation.  This retrospective also is very low facilitation-impact needed - so you can be part of the retrospective too!

I wrote an longer version of this [description on my blog](http://www.marcusoft.net/2017/04/the-walking-turn-up-the-good-retrospective.html)

This retrospective takes about 45 minutes. You need outdoor clothes.

## Preparations

* Find a location about 10-12 walk away. From EpiCenter it would be the castle or the town hall for example
* Meet at your desks at the time for the retrospective, with their outdoor clothes nearby.
* Prepare two post-its or space on your board to write down the improvement actions

## Review (5 min)

- Read the previous improvment actions
- Did we do them?
  - If no - why not?
  - If yes - what happened? Did we see an improvement? How?
- What should we think about writing new action items?

## Generate data (20 min)

* Ask the group to divide up in pairs (or threes)
* Tell the location you are going to.
  * You might wanna share [a link](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Monument+of+Engelbrekt/@59.3269106,18.0537184,18z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x465f77df9092cde9:0xaeafc90d911394c0!2sStockholm+City+Hall!8m2!3d59.3274506!4d18.0543456!3m4!1s0x465f77dfe15408c5:0xe0dedc4328babf00!8m2!3d59.3270244!4d18.0563354?hl=en) to the exact location
* Give a, one, postive-spun question to talk and ponder, for example:
  * "What was the best thing that happened last iteration?"
  * "What made us great last week"
  * "What was the thing that made you happy"
* Head off to your location
  * Tell them to walk to the location and in their pairs talk about the topic chosen
* Join one pair as you walk.

## Gather insights (20 min)

### The sight

* Once you meet at the location you decide - share what each pair talked about
* Then pose the walk-back-home-question:
  * "How can we amplify that good thing in the next week(s)"
* Change pairs - so that I don't walk with all the same people back home
  * Walk back home

### The homecoming

* When you are back home - spend two minutes writing down 1-2 improvment actions.
* Use dotvoting to find one or two candidates. Not more
* Remember that the improvement actions is what we will improve in the next week
  * Not the rest of our lives for ever and ever, amen!
