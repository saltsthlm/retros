# Retrospective script - Proud and worries

The purpose of this, and every retrospective, is to help us to improve by coming up with a few concrete improvement actions that we can complete / test / do until the next retrospective.  Small, concrete actions are preferred before large lofty goals that we don't reach anytime soon. There will be another retrospective in a few weeks.

This particular retrospective is small and simple but makes a nice distinction between two topics that often gets confused and entangled: technology and process. The technology is the thing we build and the tools we use etc. The process refers how we work together and HOW we are using the tools we have. Very often we focus on the one and not the other. Or mix them up.

This retrospective takes about 45 minutes. You need a whiteboard/big paper and some post-its.

## Preparations

* Draw a smiley with a big grin (very happy) on the top,center of the whiteboard
